# Creating Bots with Microsoft Bot Framework

The demos provided in this repository are from the presentation at **ConFoo Montreal 2018**. The goal was to highlight a couple of services, [QnA Maker](https://qnamaker.ai) and [LUIS](https://luis.ai), and the basics of how to build a bot with [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com).

## Notes

- The keys for QnA Maker and LUIS have been removed from the demo
  - To recreate the LUIS model by importing the [JSON definition](./confoo-ragnar.json)
  - To create the QnA Maker implementation, you can use the [Ragnar FAQ](https://www.runragnar.com/ragnar-road-blog/2017/04/ragnar-relay-101-a-beginners-faq/)
